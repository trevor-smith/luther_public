The goal of this project is to scrape boxofficemojo.com for movie data related to Domestic Sales.  I am reviewing
each URL for every domestic movie on their website and scraping the data.  Later, I will be analyzing attributes
from these webpages to see if I can predict domestic movie sales for every movie!

The only packages needed to scrape these webpages are urllib2 and beautifulsoup4
